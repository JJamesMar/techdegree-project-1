        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my profile page. I am currently working in the hospitality industry but looking to move into the tech world. I graduated from the University of Memphis in 2019 but still have a desire to learn something new. I have decided teaching myself to code via Treehouse is the best way to feed that hunger. </p>
        <p>I joined the Navy right out of High School and learned a great deal from that experience. Serving in the military has shaped the person I am today. I hope to use what I have learned in the tech world.</p>
        <p>I believe that complicated things can be broken down into simple processes. That is how I plan to complete this tech degree because I know there will be great things to learn. </p>
